A library of helper functions that are useful for analyses of behavioral datasets in R.

You can install in one of two ways:

1) Download the most recent *.tar.gz build in the current_version/ directory, and run "install.packages('analysisHelpers.tar.gz', repos=NULL, type='source')" from the directory where the *.tar.gz file is saved.

2) Using the install_github() function from the devtools library:
library(devtools)
install_github("gbrookshire/analysis_helpers", subdir='analysisHelpers')

To contribute, alter the scripts in scripts/, and update the help documentation in man/. Then build into a packaged library by running AnalysisHelpers-CompilePackage.R. The present build is contained in the analysisHelpers/ directory.
The github page is found at https://github.com/gbrookshire/analysis_helpers.
