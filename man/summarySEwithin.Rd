\title{
Compute within-subjects standard errors
}
\description{
Get within-subjects standard error of the mean, count, mean, standard deviation, and confidence interval (default 95\%) for a numeric variable. Uses the method from Morey (2008).

}
\usage{
summarySEwithin(data = NULL, measurevar, betweenvars = NULL, withinvars = NULL, idvar = NULL, na.rm = FALSE, conf.interval = 0.95)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
a data frame.
}
  \item{measurevar}{
the name of a column that contains the variable to be summarized.
}
  \item{betweenvars}{
a vector containing names of columns of grouping variables (between subjects). Leave blank (NULL) if there are none.
}
  \item{withinvars}{
a vector containing names of columns of within-subjects variables.
}
  \item{idvar}{
the name of the column of subject identifiers.
}
  \item{na.rm}{
a boolean that indicates whether to ignore NA's.
}
  \item{conf.interval}{
the percent range of the confidence interval.
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
a data.frame that summarizes the contents of the input data. The column with the name of the dependent variable (arg: DV) gives an adjusted mean. To use the unadjusted mean (which is what you almost certainly want), use the column called <DV>.unadjusted.
\item{<Name of your measurevar>}{an adjusted mean. You probably don't want this. Instead, use the unadjusted mean.}
\item{<Name of your measurevar>.unadjusted}{unadjusted mean of the values in that group.}
\item{N}{number of observations.}
\item{se}{within-subjects standard error of the mean.}
\item{ci}{confidence interval.}
